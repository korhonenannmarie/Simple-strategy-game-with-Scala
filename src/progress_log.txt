The project has been started.

Some major changes to the technical plan:

- Monsters are now also characters
- A lot of the methods in game and UI need to be different. All UI should do is interact with the user.
- All game logic is in game, all character logic is in character.
- I've decided to forgo testing for now, since I'm making a test loop in UI to be able to test the game every time I add something

So far skeleton code has been created to Character, but now the focus will be on Game and UserInterface for a while.
I've spent about 10 hours on the project so far.

The technical plan schedule has already gone out of the window.
