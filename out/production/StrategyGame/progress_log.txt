The project has been started.

Some major changes to the technical plan:

- Monsters are now also characters
- A lot of the methods in game and UI need to be different. All UI should do is interact with the user.
- All game logic is in game, all character logic is in character.
- I've decided to forgo testing for now, since I'm making a test loop in UI to be able to test the game every time I add something

So far skeleton code has been created to Character, but now the focus will be on Game and UserInterface for a while.
I've spent about 10 hours on the project so far.

The technical plan schedule has already gone out of the window.

Progress has been very slow, I'm covered in work and seem to find very little time to work on this.

I have a basic functionality of the UI, and I'm making slow progress with the game logic and the Character class.
The next big project will be the Monster class.

I've worked on this project for about 10 hours in the last 2 weeks. It's been a little tough, and I'm very worried about
the deadline.

There has not really been any progress since last time.
However, I do have a game plan this time.

I have about two to three weeks to finish the project by the deadline. I'm going to focus on finishing the game functionality first along
with the Character class. Afterwards I will finish my Monster class and the game will be pretty much finished. I am going to omit my
testing plans and will mainly focus on testing using the UI.

16.4.
Finally, some progress.
I'm going to try to meet the first deadline, even though I got an extension to the 10th of May. I've been working on
getting the game interaction working.
