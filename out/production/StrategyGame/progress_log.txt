The project has been started.

Some major changes to the technical plan:

- Monsters are now also characters
- A lot of the methods in game and UI need to be different. All UI should do is interact with the user.
- All game logic is in game, all character logic is in character.
- I've decided to forgo testing for now, since I'm making a test loop in UI to be able to test the game every time I add something

So far skeleton code has been created to Character, but now the focus will be on Game and UserInterface for a while.
I've spent about 10 hours on the project so far.

The technical plan schedule has already gone out of the window.

20.3.

Progress has been very slow, I'm covered in work and seem to find very little time to work on this.

I have a basic functionality of the UI, and I'm making slow progress with the game logic and the Character class.
The next big project will be the Monster class.

I've worked on this project for about 10 hours in the last 2 weeks. It's been a little tough, and I'm very worried about
the deadline.
